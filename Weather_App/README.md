This Weather App is a React-based project that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API. It allows users to search for any city and instantly view current conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. The app demonstrates core React concepts including component-based structure, state management, API integration, and dynamic UI updates based on live data. It also includes responsive styling to ensure a smooth experience across devices. This project served as a practical way to explore working with external APIs, handling asynchronous data, and building interactive user interfaces with modern React.
